# Professional README Generator

## Description

This application
captures user input to generate a
high quality README.md file. This app
was created using primarily Node.js
and javaScript.

## Future Development

I will create a reactive user interface to accept user responses to prompts, and publish a README.md file


## Installation

After cloning the
repository, open the terminal and
enter 'node index.js' , this will
then direct the user to a series of
questions to answer, and generate a
README.md file.
